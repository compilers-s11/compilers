Place this entire directory in lib/analysis in your LLVM source tree.

Compiling:
For FunctionInfo, navigate to the FunctionInfo directory, and then run make
For LocalOpts, navigate to the LocalOpts directory, and then run make

Running: 
Suppose in.o is the compiled file you wish to run this pass on. LLVMDIR is the root directory of the llvm source tree. We assume opt is in your path
opt --load LLVMDIR/Debug/lib/LocalOpts.so -LocalOpts in.o -o out
